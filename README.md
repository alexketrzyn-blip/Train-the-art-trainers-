# Case Study: Artistic Workshop Empowerment – International Exchange Program

##  Project Overview
This project involved the creation of a comprehensive educational ecosystem designed to prepare 4th-grade students from a Polish Art High School (*Liceum Plastyczne*) for an international exchange in Germany. The primary objective was to equip students with the linguistic and technical skills necessary to act as **Art Instructors**, leading professional workshops for German peers and children.

##  The Challenge
Students were tasked with conducting four distinct art workshops entirely in the German language:

* **For teenagers:** Copperplate Engraving (*Kupferstich*) and Cyanotype (*Cyanotypie*).
* **For children:** Frottage (*Frottage*) and Salt Painting (*Salzmalerei*).

To succeed, students had to master professional German vocabulary, understand technical safety procedures, and coordinate complex logistics with the host school.

##  Solutions & Tools

### 1. Educational E-book: "Kunst mal vier"
* **Tool:** Microsoft Publisher
* **Level:** A2/B1 German
* **Content:** A multi-lesson guide focusing on technical terminology, historical context (e.g., Max Ernst, Anna Atkins), and step-by-step artistic processes.
* **Purpose:** Building a solid theoretical foundation and industry-specific vocabulary for the students.

### 2. Technical SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures)
* **Tool:** Confluence
* **Focus:** Safety and Precision.
* **Content:** Detailed procedures for operating heavy machinery (printing press) and handling chemicals (Cyanotype solutions).
* **Purpose:** Ensuring a safe working environment and professional instruction standards during the "Instructor-Participant" interaction.

##  Process & Coordination

* **Logistics & Communication:** Through correspondence in German, students verified the host school's technical infrastructure. They confirmed the availability of a professional printing press, which was essential for the Copperplate Engraving workshop.
* **Mentorship:** The project was overseen by a German Language Teacher. The teacher acted as a supervisor, observing the students' work and providing support only upon request, which fostered high levels of student independence and leadership.
* **Safety First:** Specific protocols were developed for using personal protective equipment (single-use latex gloves) and managing the printing press (pinch hazard prevention).

##  Results

* **Seamless Execution:** The workshops were completed successfully without any technical or safety incidents.
* **Skill Acquisition:** Students transitioned from "learners" to "instructors," demonstrating professional competence in a foreign language and technical art skills.
* **Documentation:** High-quality instructional materials (SOPs and E-book) now serve as a permanent knowledge base for future international exchanges.
